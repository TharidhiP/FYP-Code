# Final Year Project Implementation

## Automatic Knee Osteoarthritis Detection and Severity Grading Using Deep Learning

A Deep Learning model using enhanced YOLOv3 object detection algorithm to detect and classify the severity of Knee Osteoarthritis using Kellgren-Lawrence Grading System.

### Process

*Pre-processing to reduce noise, grain etc.
*CLAHE
*Enhanced YOLOv3 for knee joint detection and classification
*Output KL grade/ class with confidence score
